HatchHub – Matchmaking for Makers
HatchHub is a fully functional platform that helps students connect, collaborate, and create. Built with campus makers in mind, it simplifies how students share project ideas, find teammates with the right skills, and join hands-on initiatives.

It’s a space that encourages a learning culture on campus — one that connects, inspires, and engages students through practical, interdisciplinary collaboration. HatchHub is made to empower students to be makers.
